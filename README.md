# Eat-Da-Taco!

## **Overview**
* Eat-Da-Taco! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of tacos they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a taco's name, the app will display the taco on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each taco in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the taco will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every taco in a database, whether devoured or not.
